# Summary of Changes to Skip Already Installed Components

The kimiz app has been updated to efficiently handle already installed Wine components. Here's a summary of the changes:

## 1. Enhanced Installation Process
- The app now checks if Homebrew is already installed before trying to install it
- If Game Porting Toolkit (GPTK) is already installed, it's detected and skipped
- Winetricks installation is skipped if already present on your system

## 2. Improved User Interface
- Clear status messages when components are already installed ('Homebrew (already installed)')
- Enhanced progress indicators show what's being checked vs. what's being installed
- Better explanations in the Wine setup UI

## 3. Technical Improvements
- Added the isWinetricksInstalled() method to detect existing installations
- Updated WineStatusView to show more helpful information
- Enhanced game launch options to support proper environment variables

## 4. How It Works
When you click 'Install Wine Automatically', the app now:
1. Checks if Homebrew is already installed (skips if present)
2. Checks if Game Porting Toolkit is already installed (skips if present)
3. Checks if Winetricks is already installed (skips if present)
4. Only installs the components that are missing
5. Shows clear status updates about what's happening

This ensures a faster, more efficient setup process with no unnecessary reinstallations of components you already have.
